## Hands-On Web Scraping with Python

Welcome to the code repository for [Hands-On Web Scraping with Python](https://www.packtpub.com/product/hands-on-web-scraping-with-python/9781789533392)! I hope you find the code and data here useful. 

### Code Structure

I've kept all of the code samples in folders separated by chapters in simple format. You'll likely want to run particular code snippet. It will be far more useful for you to have colab account and [Open in Colab](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/open-in-colab/iogfkhleblhcpcekbiedikdehleodpjo) extension so you can easily import and use. Remember, all topics are structured by tree manner in respective chapters; I've done it here so you can replicate the work you see in the book.

### Code Examples

I may have not included every code sample you've found in the book, but I have included a majority of the finished scripts. 

If you have any questions about the code you see in the book, please reach out. Most of the exploration was performed using an current version of some of the libraries, so install or upgrade the prerequisite libraries in respective section.

### Extracting Bot

I have added an image extracting bot to extract images from instragram based on hashtags.

### Reference

Code reference is based on [Hands-On Web Scraping with Python](https://www.packtpub.com/product/hands-on-web-scraping-with-python/9781789533392) book and [Code](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-On-Web-Scraping-with-Python) Repository
